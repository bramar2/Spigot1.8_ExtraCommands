# Spigot1.8_ExtraCommands
### Use at your own risk. Backup before using. I am, in no way, responsible for any damages that could directly or indirectly be caused by this plugin.
Minecraft Spigot 1.8 Plugin for Commands and Random stuff like:
- CustomEnchants system which is quite versatile and customizable with 28 COMMAND, 16 CHECK, 44 DEFAULT ENCHANTS and supports custom user enchants using .JSON and .JAVA (with ClassLoader, although could be vulnerable to attacks!)
- Custom mobs
- Hypixel TNT/Fireball
- Custom BlockDropItemEvent &   PlayerLandEvent for 1.8
- NoKB and PunchBot using Citizens


### Made a long time ago. Little to no support will be given. Repo is mainly for archive.
